## About the game
this design simulates a popular toy from the 80s. The objective is to line up 4 tiles of your color. It can be horizontally, vertically or diagonally. - Were you the first to line up 4 chips??? Congratulations! You won!
I applied the knowledge gained in the first weeks of ironhack's bootcamp web development.

## About the Developer
I'm a web development fan excited about new knowledge.
